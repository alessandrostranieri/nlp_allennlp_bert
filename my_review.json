{"sentence":  "Bohemian Rhapsody tells the story of the renowned band Queen, covering its first until the peak of its popularity. The movie does a great job in presenting the development of Freddie Mercury, the singer of the band. However, I was left with wanting to know more about the other the band members. As the story progresses, the movie was able to make me experience very different feelings, depending on the particular stage in the band's life. I felt the tension present between the young singer and his conservative family, anger as the success was giving way to his arrogance, to sorrow, as he begins to face its deadly fate. Unfortunately the story presents also several inaccuracies but, in spite of that, it's a moving story. The music is unsurprisingly great, the costumes accurate and the main actor's performance, impeccable."}
{"sentence":  "Great pictures, astounding imagery and body-shaking sound effects can not make up for a poor plot and bad writing. In Interstellar, humanity faces extinction on Earth. A crew of astronauts embarks in a first-of-a-king voyage in the hope to find a new home. During the adventure, the viewer will be given some of the most beautiful and allegedly realistic rendition of astronomical events. Sadly, despite its beauty, there are just too many absurdities on which the story is based. We are made to believe that humanity is at a level of civilazation that allows fast space travel and escape from a black hole. However, it is not capable to fight crop diseases and the only viable solution seems to be the development of a incredibly sophisticated engine to evacuate humanity, or risking thousands of embryos to grow on reboot humanity in an unknown part of the universe. As I was still trying to find a way to go past the non-sensical plot, I had to witness one of the crew members, allegedly a scientist, arguing the possibility that love is a physical force."}
